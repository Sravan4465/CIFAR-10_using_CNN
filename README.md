Image Classification using CNN

Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and implementing two models for performing classification on CIFAR-10 dataset.

CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 images of size 32x32x3.

I have implemented two models one without data augmentation and other with data augmentation.
